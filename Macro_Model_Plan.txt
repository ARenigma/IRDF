Project Plan: Macroeconomic Signal Engine for Business Decision Support
Let's break this down into key components:

Project Concept: Create a predictive model that connects macroeconomic signals to business performance metrics
Learning Path: Cover required technologies and concepts
Implementation: Build the actual model
Documentation: Prepare presentation materials for interviews

1. Project Concept
Based on the JD, we should build a model that:

Takes macroeconomic indicators as input
Predicts business-relevant outcomes (e.g., demand forecasting for a specific sector)
Creates interpretable insights for decision-makers

Suggested Project: "India Retail Demand Forecaster" - A model that predicts retail sales in India based on macroeconomic signals.
2. Learning Path
Let's cover the technologies mentioned in the JD:
Python Data Science Stack

Python fundamentals (if needed)
NumPy/Pandas for data manipulation
Scikit-learn for ML models
Basic API handling for data collection

Machine Learning Focus Areas

Time series forecasting (crucial for economic data)
Regression/classification fundamentals
Feature engineering from economic data
Model evaluation techniques

Economic Concepts

Macroeconomic indicators and their relationships
Business cycle analysis
Sector-specific drivers (focusing on retail)

3. Implementation Plan
Let's break the project into manageable phases:
Phase 1: Data Collection & Exploration

Collect Indian macroeconomic data (GDP, inflation, interest rates, etc.)
Collect retail sector performance data
Explore relationships and correlations

Phase 2: Feature Engineering

Create lag features from economic indicators
Generate derived features (e.g., rate of change, volatility)
Create custom indicators as mentioned in the JD

Phase 3: Model Building

Implement time series models (ARIMA, Prophet)
Implement ML models (regression, ensemble methods)
Evaluate and compare model performance

Phase 4: Visualization & Interpretation

Create dashboards to visualize predictions
Develop explanations for model decisions
Connect macro signals to business implications

4. Interview Preparation
The JD mentions a 4-round interview process. Let's prepare for each:

Task Round: Your project will be excellent preparation
ML Fundamentals: Focus on time series models and evaluation metrics
Economics & Sector Logic: Study how economic indicators impact retail in India
Systems & Product Thinking: Prepare to discuss how your model could be deployed as a product
