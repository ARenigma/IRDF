## 3. Key Economic Concepts

### 3.1 Macroeconomic Indicators

#### GDP Growth
GDP (Gross Domestic Product) growth measures the increase in a country's economic output. In our model, it serves as a primary indicator of overall economic health and consumer spending power.

#### Inflation
Inflation represents the rate at which prices for goods and services rise over time. We track inflation through:
- Consumer Price Index (CPI): Measures changes in the price level of a basket of consumer goods and services
- Wholesale Price Index (WPI): Measures changes in the price of goods in wholesale markets

#### Interest Rates
Interest rates affect borrowing costs for both businesses and consumers. Our model includes:
- Repo Rate: The rate at which the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) lends to commercial banks
- Lending Rate: The rate at which commercial banks lend to customers

#### Industrial Production
Industrial Production Index (IIP) measures real production output, providing insights into the manufacturing sector's performance. We distinguish between:
- Durable Goods: Products with a longer lifespan (e.g., appliances, vehicles)
- Non-durable Goods: Items consumed quickly (e.g., food, toiletries)

#### Commodity Prices
- **Gold Prices**: Gold has special significance in Indian culture and serves as both an inflation hedge and wealth indicator
- **Crude Oil Prices**: As a major import for India, oil prices impact transportation costs and overall inflation

### 3.2 Economic Relationships in the Indian Context

#### Gold Price and Retail Demand
Gold has cultural significance in India with substantial demand driven by weddings, festivals, and investment. Rising gold prices can both signal and cause:
- Wealth effect among gold owners
- Potential reduction in discretionary spending as gold consumes a larger portion of savings
- Indicator of economic uncertainty when prices rise sharply

#### Oil Price and Retail Sales
As a major oil importer, India's economy is sensitive to oil price fluctuations:
- Higher oil prices increase transportation and manufacturing costs
- These costs are often passed to consumers, potentially reducing purchasing power
- Rising oil prices can signal global economic uncertainty

#### Seasonal Patterns in Indian Retail
Retail sales in India show strong seasonality due to:
- Festival seasons (Diwali, Dussehra, Eid)
- Wedding season (typically October-December and April-May)
- Harvest cycles in agricultural regions
- Budget announcements and tax implications

## 4. Data Processing Pipeline

### 4.1 Data Collection and Cleaning

#### Raw Data Sources
The model integrates various economic indicators from Excel and CSV files located in the `data/raw` directory:
- Gold price data (gold_price.xlsx, gold_price_processed.csv)

- Outlier detection and capping
- Date format standardization
- Visualization of before/after states

### 4.2 Feature Engineering (features.py)

The `features.py` module creates a rich set of features from the raw economic indicators:

#### Key Functions
- `merge_all_signals()`: Combines data from multiple sources aligned by date
- `generate_lag_features()`: Creates lagged versions of indicators (e.g., GDP from 1, 3, 6 months ago)
- `generate_rolling_features()`: Creates rolling window statistics (e.g., 3-month average inflation)
- `generate_date_features()`: Extracts calendar features (month, quarter, cyclical encodings)
- `prepare_features_and_target()`: Prepares the final dataset for modeling, including normalization and imputation

#### Feature Categories
1. **Lag Features**: Capture the delayed impact of economic changes
   - Example: GDP growth from 3 months ago may affect current retail sales

2. **Rolling Statistics**: Capture trends and volatility
   - Rolling means: Smooth out noise in economic indicators
   - Rolling standard deviations: Measure economic volatility

3. **Date Features**: Capture seasonality and cyclicality
   - Cyclical encoding of month and quarter (sine/cosine transformations)
   - Special period indicators (festival season, budget announcement)

4. **Interaction Features**: Capture relationships between indicators
   - Ratios between related indicators
   - Differences between related indicators

## 5. Modeling Approach (model.py)

The `model.py` module implements multiple forecasting approaches to capture different aspects of retail demand patterns.

### 5.1 Machine Learning Models

### 6.6 Economic Logic of Scenarios and Their Effects

The scenarios are designed based on established economic relationships that impact retail demand in India. Our model applies these key economic relationships to forecast how different economic conditions affect retail sales:

### Key Economic Relationships

1. **GDP Growth (+0.4)**: Strong positive correlation with retail sales
   - As GDP grows, consumer income and purchasing power increase
   - Business expansion creates employment and wage growth
   - Consumer confidence rises, encouraging discretionary spending
   - Effect: Each 1% change in GDP growth creates approximately 0.4% change in retail sales growth

2. **Inflation (-0.2)**: Moderate negative impact on retail sales
   - Higher inflation erodes purchasing power
   - Consumers prioritize essential purchases and delay discretionary spending
   - Fixed-income households particularly affected
   - Effect: Each 1% increase in inflation typically reduces retail sales growth by 0.2%

3. **Interest Rates (-0.15)**: Moderate negative impact on retail sales
   - Higher interest rates increase borrowing costs
   - Consumer credit becomes more expensive
   - Durable goods purchases often delayed due to financing costs
   - Effect: Each 1% increase in interest rates reduces retail sales growth by approximately 0.15%

4. **Gold Prices (+0.15)**: Positive impact on retail sales in India
   - Gold is culturally significant in Indian households
   - Rising gold prices create a wealth effect for gold owners
   - Weddings and festivals drive gold-related retail spending
   - Effect: Each 1% increase in gold prices typically increases retail sales by 0.15%

5. **Oil Prices (-0.1)**: Negative impact on retail sales
   - Higher oil prices increase transportation and manufacturing costs
   - These costs are passed to consumers, reducing purchasing power
   - Creates inflationary pressure throughout supply chains
   - Effect: Each 1% increase in oil prices reduces retail sales growth by approximately 0.1%

### Scenario Effects and Economic Logic

#### Baseline Scenario
- **Economic Logic**: Continuation of current economic trends
- **Parameters**: GDP growth ~6%, inflation ~4.5-5%, steady interest rates ~6.5%
- **Expected Effect**: Stable retail sales growth matching recent historical patterns
- **Forecast Pattern**: Modest upward trajectory with seasonal variations
- **Business Implications**: Familiar planning environment for retailers, predictable inventory and staffing needs

#### High Growth Scenario
- **Economic Logic**: Accelerated economic expansion with productivity gains
- **Parameters**: GDP growth 7-8%, moderate inflation rising to 6.5%, gradually increasing interest rates
- **Key Drivers**: 
  - Strong GDP growth boosts consumer purchasing power
  - Rising inflation partially offsets this advantage
  - Increasing interest rates dampen consumer credit expansion
  - Lower gold price growth reduces wealth effect
  - Higher oil prices create supply chain cost pressures
- **Expected Effect**: Initial strong sales growth gradually moderating as inflation and interest rate effects accumulate
- **Forecast Pattern**: Strong upward trajectory that gradually levels off
- **Business Implications**: Opportunity for retail expansion, premium product lines, and new market entry

#### Stagflation Scenario
- **Economic Logic**: Economic stagnation combined with high inflation
- **Parameters**: Low GDP growth (2-4%), high inflation (7-9%), rising interest rates
- **Key Drivers**:
  - Weak GDP growth reduces purchasing power and consumer confidence
  - High inflation erodes real incomes
  - Rising interest rates further constrain consumer spending
  - Higher gold prices (safe haven effect) provide insufficient offset
  - Higher oil prices contribute to inflationary pressure
- **Expected Effect**: Steady decline in retail sales as economic pressures compound
- **Forecast Pattern**: Downward trajectory accelerating over time
- **Business Implications**: Shift to value offerings, focus on essential goods, margin pressure

#### Recession Scenario
- **Economic Logic**: Economic contraction triggering deflationary pressures
- **Parameters**: Negative GDP growth, deflation/low inflation, decreasing interest rates
- **Key Drivers**:
  - GDP contraction sharply reduces consumer spending capacity
  - Job losses and wage cuts limit discretionary purchasing
  - Lower interest rates provide insufficient stimulus
  - Gold price increases (safe haven effect) offer partial offset
  - Falling oil prices provide minor relief on costs
- **Expected Effect**: Initial sharp decline in retail sales followed by stabilization at lower levels
- **Forecast Pattern**: Downward trajectory with eventual leveling off as economic conditions stabilize
- **Business Implications**: Focus on operational efficiency, inventory reduction, potential for consolidation

#### Gold Boom Scenario
- **Economic Logic**: Sharp rise in gold prices with moderate economic growth
- **Parameters**: Moderate GDP growth (~5.5%), mild inflation increase, gold price surge (20-30% YoY)
- **Key Drivers**:
  - Stable GDP provides consistent base economic activity
  - Rising gold prices create significant wealth effect in gold-owning households
  - Cultural significance of gold in Indian weddings and festivals accelerates spending
  - Moderate inflation and interest rate increases have limited dampening effect
  - Stable oil prices maintain transportation and manufacturing costs
- **Expected Effect**: Substantial increase in retail sales, particularly in jewelry, luxury goods, and wedding-related categories
- **Forecast Pattern**: Strong upward trajectory exceeding other scenarios
- **Business Implications**: Opportunity for premium and luxury retailers, expansion in wedding-related categories

### Implementation Mechanics

In the implementation, each scenario applies these economic relationships through a weighted impact model:

```python
# Define impact weights of different economic factors
weights = {
    'gdp_growth': 0.4,      # GDP has strong positive correlation
    'inflation': -0.2,       # Inflation has negative impact
    'interest_rate': -0.15,  # Interest rates have negative impact
    'gold_price_yoy': 0.15,  # Gold prices have moderate positive impact in India
    'oil_price_yoy': -0.1    # Oil prices have small negative impact
}
```

For each forecast period, the model:
1. Calculates the deviation of each parameter from baseline values
2. Applies the corresponding weight to determine the impact
3. Combines these impacts to calculate the period adjustment
4. Applies cumulative adjustments over time to simulate compounding effects

This approach creates realistic scenario forecasts that reflect the complex interplay of different economic factors on Indian retail demand.
